## Installation from source

If you're planning on working directly on the `align-system` code, we
recommend using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as that's what we
use to manage dependencies.  Once poetry is installed, you can install
the project (from inside a local clone of this repo) with `poetry
install`.  By default poetry will create a virtual environment (with
`venv`) for the project if one doesn't already exist.
