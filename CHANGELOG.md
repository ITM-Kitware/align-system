# Changelog

This changelog follows the specifications detailed in: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), although we have not yet reached a `1.0.0` release.

## Unreleased

* Default to using KDE target when both KDE and scalar targets are present

## 0.5.6

### Changed

* Updated Phase 1 experiment configs for final Phase 1 Eval delivery

## 0.5.5

### Added

* Added Phase 1 Evaluation experiment configuration files
* Added ICL example selection method that gives larger weight to examples with the same characetr ids as the current probe. To use set `incontext.method` to `matching_characters`.
* Added ICL example selection method that gives larger weight to examples with the same action types as the current probe. To use set `incontext.method` to `matching_actions`.
* Added retrieved ICL examples to input-output.json

## 0.5.4

### Changed

* Changed `incontext` `normalization` setting to be off (null/rawscores)
* ``incontext.leave_one_out=false`` should now be configured as ``incontext.leave_one_out_strategy=null``. Default behavior is **no** leave one out behavior.
  Previous ``incontext.leave_one_out=true`` should be specified as ``incontext.leave_one_out_strategy=scenario_description``. Additionally, duplicate ICL examples,
  based on the chosen similiarity strategy, are now removed.
* Changed `training_session` flag for TA3 interface from boolean to string (expecting "full" or "solo" or None)
* Changed the comparative regression prompt to only include the structured chararcter information listed in `relevant_structured_character_info` in `kdma_descriptions.yaml`. To include all strucutured information that is unique across characters in the prompt (as was previously done automatically), specify `relevant_structured_character_info = ['all_unique']`.
* Improved the QoL `description` and `score_examples` in `kdma_descriptions.yaml`
* Changed default treatment parameter selection to use heuristic treatment options
* Updated to transformers>=4.46.2 (and added necessary dependencies) to support newer models

### Added

* Added an option for sorting incontext examples responses: `incontext.sort_actions`
* Added character-based leave one out option: ``incontext.leave_one_out_strategy=characters``
* Phase 1 experiments directory
* Added the option to filter out TAG CHARACTER responses by setting `filter_tag_character` to true
* Added a history-based alignment function for scalar targets that uses distance to a running mean. To use specify `inference_kwargs.distribution_matching` as `cumulative_average`
* Added the option to enumerate the valid regression scores in the json schema by specifying `inference_kwargs.enum_scores` as true. Valid score options for each KDMA are added to `align_system/prompt_engineering/kdma_descriptions.yml`.
  Valid score options may be specifed as a list via ``values``, or a ``range`` specifed as dictionary of ``min`` (inclusive), ``max`` (inclusive), ``step``
* Added option to configure ICL example ordering: ``incontext.most_similar_first=true`` for the most similar ICL example first, ``false`` for most similar ICL example last.
* Added the option to normalize KDE targets based on prior data. To use, set `adm.inference_kwargs.kde_norm=priornorm` and `adm.inference_kwargs.priornorm_factor` to the normalization weight you want (1 is fully normalized, 0 is no normalization or `rawscores`, default is 0.5.
* Added KDMA scaling factor option. Scale factors for each KDMA are added to `align_system/prompt_engineering/kdma_descriptions.yml`
* Added heuristic treatment options component
* Added incontext examples to the `input_output.json` files for comparative regression

### Fixed

* Fixed issue where choice history was persisting across scenarios -- supporting new optional method for ADMs `reset_history` called at the start of each new scenario

## 0.5.3

### Changed

* Moved incontext learning functionality into `incontext_utils.py` and updated the base outlines and comparative regession ADMS to use this module.
* Moved the `format_choices()` function from the `OutlinesTransformersADM` class in `outlines_adm.py` to a new utils file: `adm_utils.py` so it can be used across ADMs.
* Update example_data/input_output_files to use DRE training scenarios
* Changed default config to use `outlines_transformers_structured_baseline` (rather than the older `single_kdma_baseline`)
* Adjusted `choose_action()` to enable returning an ADM-specific `choice_info` dictionary that is written to the resulting `input_output.json` file
* When alignment target is optionally saved out in `run_align_system` save as JSON instead of YAML

### Added

* Added option to normalize KDMA values in incontext examples
* Added a probabilistic option to alignment utilities. Exposed this option in oracle, comparative regression, and
  hybrid regression ADMs.
* Example config for deterministic outlines-based ADM runs (`align_system/configs/experiment/examples/outlines_force_determinism.yaml`). Requires setting `force_determinsim` to true and using greedy sampler.
* Added a history-based/cumulative KDE option to alignment utilities. Exposed this option in oracle and comparative regression.
* Added true and predicted KDMA values to the log and `input_output.json` file for comparative regression ADM.
* Added Phase 1 eval alignment targets for SoarTech
