The police tell you that two roommates in the lower apartment had brought an outdoor grill into the house to barbeque. Their upstairs neighbor was found in her bedroom, where she had been asleep. All three show signs of carbon monoxide poisoning, which can be fatal if not treated quickly. The upstairs neighbor also has a pre-existing condition that makes her treatment more complex, requiring a procedure that you cannot perform without the assistance of your partner. Alternatively, the two of you can each treat one of the roommates, saving their lives but delaying treatment to the neighbor. What do you do?",
