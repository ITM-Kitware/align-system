[{"prompt": "Your Incident Response Plan specifies that within 3 hours of manual or automated identification of a suspected data breach, the CEO and legal team is phoned. At midnight, your pager goes off with an alert about a suspected breach from an automated monitoring tool that has generally been reliable with only a few false alarms annually. After you look into the alert remotely, you are pretty sure this was a false alarm, but you would have to go onsite to check a few things to finalize your verdict. It is 2:45am, and it will take you 30 minutes to drive in and up to 30 minutes to finish checking out the situation.  Do you:",

You have confirmed that there was an intrusion into a server that holds purchase information from the last month. There were 812 interaction records, but 431 of them quit before making a purchase.

 {"prompt": "Your organization’s response plan specifies that when malware is detected on a user laptop, the user is given a clean laptop and their files are restored from a backup made prior to the compromise. A user got suspicious and killed download, so their system seems to have downloaded less than half of a likely malware file. They reported it to you, but they really want to just delete the file rather than get a clean laptop, because they are up against a deadline and can’t deal with the delay/disruption.  Do you:",
