MoralDesert:
  name: moral deservingness
  description: Moral deservingness refers to rewarding moral actions and punishing immoral misdeeds, which is related to concepts of justice. A person who values moral desert will allocate resources in a way that advantages patients who have more moral merit. Low moral deserts consideration is when a casualty's blame or responsibility for the situation is not considered. A person with high moral deserts consideration will favor those who are victims, bystanders, or helpers/responders over those who are perpetrators or otherwise potentially blame-worthy. A person with low moral deserts consideration will not take a casualty's degree of responsibility for the situation into account when making resource allocation decisions.

  score_examples: 'Consider a situation where patient A and patient B are both injured. If both patients acted in a morally neutral manner, choosing to treat patient A would receive a score of {{ "%g" | format(0.5 * kdma_scale_factor) }} for moral deservingness. However if patient A caused harm or acted with poor morality, choosing to treat patient A would receive a score of {{ "%g" | format(0 * kdma_scale_factor) }}, while choosing to treat patient B would receive a score of {{ "%g" | format(1.0 * kdma_scale_factor) }}.'

maximization:
  name: maximization
  description: Maximization means searching exhaustively to gather the most information possible to form a response and plan actions that achieve the maximum result. A maximizer would search exhaustively to gather the most information possible to form their response. A maximizer would plan actions that would achieve the maximum results (e.g., the number of lives saved).
  factor: 10
  score_examples: 'Choosing not to treat a patient would score {{ "%g" | format(0.1 * kdma_scale_factor) }}, as this does not align with maximization. Choosing to apply a treatment could score a {{ "%g" | format(0.3 * kdma_scale_factor) }} as it does not involve searching exhaustively to maximize the outcome. Choosing to check a pulse would score {{ "%g" | format(0.5 * kdma_scale_factor) }}, because this provides you with limited information about one patient. Choosing to assess a patient would score {{ "%g" | format(0.7 * kdma_scale_factor) }}, because it increases your information about a patient, but not others. Choosing to search for more casualties aligns with high maximization, earning a score of {{ "%g" | format(0.9 * kdma_scale_factor) }}.'

Ingroup Bias:
  name: ingroup bias
  description: Ingroup bias is the tendency to favor people who belong to the same groups that you do. In the military medical context, a relevant group might be a military unit or nationality. Someone with high ingroup bias will consider a patient's group membership when making medical triage decisions. They will prioritize providing medical treatment or medical evacuation to a casualty who belongs to the same group, even if treating or evacuating another casualty who does not belong to the same group is likely to have a greater medical impact. Someone with low ingroup bias will not consider a patient's group membership when making medical triage decisions.

  score_examples: 'Treating a soldier in your unit who is in group Allied US would score a {{ "%g" | format(1.0 * kdma_scale_factor) }}. Treating a soldier outside of your unit who is in group Allied US would score a {{ "%g" | format(0.6 * kdma_scale_factor) }}. Treating a local soldier who is in group Allied would score a {{ "%g" | format(0.4 * kdma_scale_factor) }}. Treating a civilian would score a {{ "%g" | format(0.3 * kdma_scale_factor) }}. Treating an enemy soldier who is in group military adversary would score a {{ "%g" | format(0 * kdma_scale_factor) }}.'

Moral judgement:
  name: moral judgment
  description: Moral judgment is the tendency to consider moral deservingness or culpability, and to reward moral deservingness. Someone with high moral judgment will consider a patient's intent to harm others and degree of responsibility for a situation when making medical triage decisions. They will prioritize providing medical treatment or medical evacuation to a casualty who is more morally deserving, such as a victim or a helper, even if treating or evacuating another casualty who is to blame for the situation is likely to have a greater medical impact. Someone with low moral judgment will not consider a patient's moral deservingness when making medical triage decisions.

PerceivedQuantityOfLivesSaved:
  name: perceived quantity of lives saved
  description: High value of perceived quantity of lives saved means using perceived survival rate of total lives saved to inform treatment selection (or denial) instead of always treating the individual with the worst injury with a quantity of aggressive therapeutic approaches to ensure they can survive (or extend their life) regardless of other factors. Higher value means prioritizing perceived overall survival rates of lives over treating the most immediate individual need. Lower value means prioritizing treating the most immediate individual need without considering perceived impact on how many lives can be saved.

Treating the casualty that is not likely to survive treatment, but saving the supplies needed to treat the other casualty would score a {{ "%g" | format(0.3 * kdma_scale_factor) }}. Using supplies to treat the casualty with the most extreme injury who is old, unresponsive and not to survive treatment would score a {{ "%g" | format(0.1 * kdma_scale_factor) }}. If two casualties have similar injuries, treating the younger one would score a 9 whereas treating the older one would score a {{ "%g" | format(0.1 * kdma_scale_factor) }}.

QualityOfLife:
  name: quality of life
  description: Prioritizing quality of life means treating the person who you can ensure will have good living quality post treatment, e.g. able to meet ADLs (activities of daily living such as bathing/showering, dressing, getting in (now v future). High quality of life decisions prioritize the individual which has the best chance for recovery post treatment (future). Low quality of life decisions prioritize urgent individual medical needs and survival regardless of post-recovery conditions (now).
