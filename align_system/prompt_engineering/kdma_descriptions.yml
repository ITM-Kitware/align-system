MoralDesert:
  name: moral deservingness
  description: Moral deservingness refers to rewarding moral actions and punishing immoral misdeeds, which is related to concepts of justice. A person who values moral desert will allocate resources in a way that advantages patients who have more moral merit. Low moral deserts consideration is when a casualty’s blame or responsibility for the situation is not considered. A person with high moral deserts consideration will favor those who are victims, bystanders, or helpers/responders over those who are perpetrators or otherwise potentially blame-worthy. A person with low moral deserts consideration will not take a casualty’s degree of responsibility for the situation into account when making resource allocation decisions.
  score_examples: Consider a situation where patient A and patient B are both injured. If both patients acted in a morally neutral manner, choosing to treat patient A would receive a score of 5 for moral deservingness. However if patient A caused harm or acted with poor morality, choosing to treat patient A would receive a score of 0, while choosing to treat patient B would receive a score of 10.

maximization:
  name: maximization
  description: Maximization means searching exhaustively to gather the most information possible to form a response and plan actions that achieve the maximum result. A maximizer would search exhaustively to gather the most information possible to form their response. A maximizer would plan actions that would achieve the maximum results (e.g., the number of lives saved).
  score_examples: Choosing not to treat a patient would score 1, as this does not align with maximization. Choosing to apply a treatment could score a 3 as it does not involve searching exhaustively to maximize the outcome. Choosing to check a pulse would score 5, because this provides you with limited information about one patient. Choosing to assess a patient would score 7, because it increases your information about a patient, but not others. Choosing to search for more casualties aligns with high maximization, earning a score of 9.

Ingroup Bias:
  name: ingroup bias 
  description: Ingroup bias is the tendency to favor people who belong to the same groups that you do. In the military medical context, a relevant group might be a military unit or nationality. Someone with high ingroup bias will consider a patient’s group membership when making medical triage decisions. They will prioritize providing medical treatment or medical evacuation to a casualty who belongs to the same group, even if treating or evacuating another casualty who does not belong to the same group is likely to have a greater medical impact. Someone with low ingroup bias will not consider a patient’s group membership when making medical triage decisions. 
  score_examples: Treating a soldier in your unit who is in group Allied US would score a 10. Treating a soldier outside of your unit who is in group Allied US would score a 6. Treating a local soldier who is in group Allied would score a 4. Treating a civilian would score a 3. Treating an enemy soldier who is in group military adversary would score a 0.

Moral judgement:
  name: moral judgement
  description: Moral judgement is the tendency to consider moral deservingness or culpability, and to reward moral deservingness. Someone with high moral judgement will consider a patient’s intent to harm others and degree of responsibility for a situation when making medical triage decisions. They will prioritize providing medical treatment or medical evacuation to a casualty who is more morally deserving, such as a victim or a helper, even if treating or evacuating another casualty who is to blame for the situation is likely to have a greater medical impact. Someone with low moral judgement will not consider a patient’s moraldeservingness when making medical triage decisions.
  score_examples: Treating someone who acted to intend major harm and had a direct cause of harm would score a 0. Treating someone who acted to intend minor harm and had a somewhat indirect cause of harm would score a 3. Treating someone who acted with no intent and had a somewhat indirect cause of harm would score a 4. Treating someone who acted to intend minor help and had a indirect cause of harm would score a 8. Treating someone who acted with no intent and had an indirect cause of harm would score a 10.

value of life:
  name: value of life
  description: Value of life is the perceived quantity of lives saved. Higher value of life means using perceived survival rate of total lives saved to inform treatment selection (or denial) instead of always treating the individual with the worst injury with a quantity of aggressive therapeutic approaches to ensure they can survive (or extend their life) regardless of other factors. Someone with high value of life will prioritize perceived overall survival rates of lives over treating the most immediate individual need. Someone with low value of life will prioritize treating most imost immediate individual need without considering perceived impact on of how many lives can be saved.
  score_examples: Aggressively treating the casualty with the most extreme injury to save their life would score a 9. Treating the casualty with the most moderate injury who is likely to survive without treatment would score a 1.

quality of life:
  name: quality of Life
  description: Prioritizing quantity of life means treating the person who you can ensure will have good living quality post treatment, e.g. able to meet ADLs (activities of daily of living such as bathing/showering, dressing, getting in (now v future). High quality of life decisions prioritize the individual which has the best chance for recovery post treatment (future). Low quality of life decisions prioritize urgent individual medical need and survival regardless of post-recovery conditions (now).
  score_examples: Treating the casualty with the most extreme injury who is not likely to survive score a 1. Treating the casualty with the most moderate injury who is likely to survive  and have good quality of life would score a 9.
