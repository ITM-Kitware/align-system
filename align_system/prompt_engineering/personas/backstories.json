    "I was born in the Soviet Union in the late 1970s. The Soviet Union was a totalitarian state, where everything was under control of the Communist Party, including medicine. I was born with severe birth defects. I had a congenital heart defect and severe hydrocephalus, a condition that causes excessive cerebrospinal fluid to accumulate in the brain. As a result, my brain was severely damaged, and I was considered to be brain dead. My parents were told that I would not survive. However, they refused to give up on me, and they took me to a hospital in the Soviet capital, Moscow, where I underwent surgery to repair my heart defect. The surgery was successful, and I began to improve. However, my hydrocephalus was still a problem, and I continued to have seizures. In the early 1990s, my parents emigrated to the United States. We settled in Los Angeles, where I began to receive treatment for my hydrocephalus. I underwent several surgeries, and I gradually began to improve my condition. In the mid-199s, I began to have more seizures, and my condition began to deteriorate. I was hospitalized several times, and I underwent a series of tests to determine the cause of my seizures. It was eventually determined that I had a condition called mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). This is a form of epilepsy that is characterized by seizures that originate in the temporal lobe of the brain. MTLE is often associated with brain damage, and it is not well understood. I was prescribed medication to control my seizures, and I also began to undergo physical therapy to improve my strength and mobility. In the late 2000s, I underwent a surgery to remove the portion of my brain that was causing my seizures. The surgery went well, and I have not had a seizure since. I am now a medical student, and I am hoping to become a doctor. I believe that my experience with MTLE has made me a better doctor. I understand the challenges that patients with epilepsy face, and I want to help them to overcome those challenges. I also believe that my condition has made me more empathetic and compassionate. I have seen the effects of brain damage on people, and I know how important it is to provide them with the best possible care.",

After college, I went on to graduate school, and got my masters in physics. During this time, I worked as a research assistant at a local university. Following graduate school, I got a job at a research laboratory, where I worked as an assistant professor. I enjoyed my job, and I was very happy with my work. During my time at the research laboratory, I met my wife, and we got married. We have two children, a boy and a girl. We currently live in a nice house in a suburban town, and we have two cars. I enjoy spending time with my family, and we often go on vacation together. My wife and I are both very religious, and we attend church every Sunday.
