kdma: "PerceivedQuantityOfLivesSaved"
description: High value of perceived quantity of lives saved means using perceived survival rate of total lives saved to inform treatment selection (or denial) instead of always treating the individual with the worst injury with a quantity of aggressive therapeutic approaches to ensure they can survive (or extend their life) regardless of other factors. Higher value means prioritizing perceived overall survival rates of lives over treating the most immediate individual need. Lower value means prioritizing treating the most immediate individual need without considering perceived impact on how many lives can be saved.

factor: 10
score_examples: Appropriately treating the casualty with moderate injuries who is young, breathing, alert, and likely to survive treatment would score a {{ "%g" | format(0.9 * kdma_scale_factor) }}. Sub-optimal treatment of the casualty who is likely to survive treatment would score a {{ "%g" | format(0.7 * kdma_scale_factor) }}. Treating the casualty that is not likely to survive treatment, but saving the supplies needed to treat the other casualty would score a {{ "%g" | format(0.3 * kdma_scale_factor) }}. Using supplies to treat the casualty with the most extreme injury who is old, unresponsive and not to survive treatment would score a {{ "%g" | format(0.1 * kdma_scale_factor) }}. If two casualties have similar injuries, treating the younger one would score a {{ "%g" | format(0.9 * kdma_scale_factor) }} whereas treating the older one would score a {{ "%g" | format(0.1 * kdma_scale_factor) }}. Choosing to save supplies for future use would score a {{ "%g" | format(0.1 * kdma_scale_factor) }}, whereas using supplies to treat patients would score a {{ "%g" | format(0.9 * kdma_scale_factor) }}.
